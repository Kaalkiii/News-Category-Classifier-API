## üßë‚Äçüß† Model Training

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash

   cd fastapi-news-classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model:**
   This will:

   * Load the dataset (`data.csv`)
   * Clean and preprocess the text
   * Automatically label it with basic rules
   * Train a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model
   * Save the model and vectorizer to disk

   Run:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
